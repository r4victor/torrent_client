## Overview

This is a command-line BitTorrent client written in pure python without third-party modules and magic.

Package includes:

`cli.py` – command-line interface entry point

`client.py` – client implementation

`bencode.py` – encoding and decoding bencode

`tracker.py` – tracker connection

`files.py` – handling torrent files

`pwp/messages.py` – building and parsing Peer Wire Protocol messages

## Using

To start or stop downloading enter a torrent number: `2`.
